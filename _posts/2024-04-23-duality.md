At last, I got my paper accepted to EAMT 2024. I have started working on this paper and submitted it to NAACL 2022 (January). Now it has been accepted.. after 2 years and 4 months! This caused me a lot of pain, this work! I am not happy, but I am relieved because I don't have to work on it anymore :) I guess this is how life teaches us not to get excited or sad about events that are happening. Nowadays, I am just spending the day reading novels... I am reading "And the Mountains Echoed" by Khaled Hosseini. It's a good read, but sometimes it gets boring, just like everyday life.
