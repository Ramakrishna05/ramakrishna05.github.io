The world we live in is so cruel and ungrateful.. especially to an introvert like me. I can understand if you are reading this and feel the same way. We share the same pain. One of the things my parents taught me is not to expect anything in return when I do something. Even Lord Krishna says that in the Gita. Unfortunately, this behaviour will cause many problems and pain because people will take advantage of it! When we ask them for help, they will say NO without hesitation. I am not saying everyone will be like this, but most will be like this. Maybe you will say that I am in bad company.! Well, I guess we will rarely be in "good" company because of introversion.

I have a few friends (unfortunately!), and all of them are good, but only with their words. They almost always say to me, "Hey! Don't worry bro... I have your back, and I am there for you." But the saddest thing is they are too busy with their work and don't care about me. But they always think I will be obliged to meet their requests! I don't understand such people. Anyway! Take care of yourself. Thanks for reading...
