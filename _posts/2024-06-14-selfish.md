Being selfish is okay, right? Most people will try to get what they want and rarely care about others. I think it's ok and alright. However, selfish needs should not come at other people's expense. I know some people prioritize others' needs over their own. Such people find it difficult to say 'No' to anyone, and I am such a person. Now, I am learning the art of saying 'No'. Is this a good behaviour? The answer changes from person to person. Most of the people say no and don't feel guilty about it. I think their default response is No! It's alright; they don't want to leave their comfort zone for others. But I feel saying no is bad manners. After all, we are humans, and one should help another. I am not saying everyone should always be ready to help others, but at least they should not say no to their friends. Maybe it's ok to be selfish and not think badly about it. It also helps me go after what I want instead of worrying about what others think...
