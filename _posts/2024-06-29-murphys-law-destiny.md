So.. Murphy's law states, "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." This is predominantly mentioned in Sir Christopher Nolan's movie (one of the masterpieces, in my opinion), Interstellar. It is in effect throughout the movie. Things have gone wrong in the film, but as Cooper says to Murph, something similar to Murphy's law is not negative or bad. I strongly believe in Murphy's law because things have been and are going wrong with me.. in every way possible... 

I love Paulo Coelho sir's writings, and The Alchemist is my favorite and one of the most essential things in my life. He says if we are destined for something, we will find it, but it will take an effort worth a lifetime... Suppose things are going wrong or we are faced with severe difficulties. In that case, it indicates that we are going in the right direction. Santiago in The Alchemist has to go through some things that he thinks are impossible, but he has achieved them.

When I think about these two things, Murphy's law and Destiny. I can see a connection. Things are going wrong, and they are supposed to if we are on the path of our Destiny. People will leave, and others will get lucky, but no such miracle happens to us. The main reason, in my opinion, is everyone's journey to succeed at their Destiny starts with beginner's luck, and then destiny tests them thoroughly before presenting itself in completely unassuming and unexpected moments. Yes, I have taken this from The Alchemist because it is so beautifully written. Now I can relate to it practically... Life is the best teacher we can ever have.. it will test us and then teach us... Yeah! I firmly believe that Murphy's law and Destiny are somehow related to each other... Thank you for reading... <3
