I have been wanting to watch the "500 Days of Summer" movie. I watched it today. It's lovely.. I can completely relate to Tom.. and how he thinks Summer is the only girl who makes him happy. Unfortunately, she was never sure about Tom. It hurt me when she said she was sure about her husband but not Tom... I don't understand why people like Tom are taken for granted. Why anyone can't make them happy? I am feeling what he was feeling... I know there is a reason for everything, but this much pain is really diabolical... It's really difficult to enjoy any connection after such a traumatic experience. Well! The people also behave like ass****s, and there is no hope for a genuine bond in current society. Either we start to cheat or end up depressed by questioning everything... Anyway.. the movie is adorable.. <3
