I am in a position where I need to start caring about myself. I have been waiting for things to happen. Miracles, if I may say! If I can be good to others, good things will happen to me.. or so I thought. Yeah, good things will happen, but I need to make decisions on my own to make them happen. I have been a people pleaser till now, and it has done more harm than good for me. Unfortunately, I was told that it was a good, people-pleasing thing. Everyone is selfish, and I don't blame them. Nowadays, being selfish is an essential lifestyle change. Unfortunately, some 'people' are taking this to the extreme. They are not doing the things they are supposed to do.

On top of that, they are demanding people like us to work now so that the future will be bright and happy. My simple question is, if I am suffering now, then how should I think about the future. So I decided to stop being 'good' and start being 'normal'. I believe that if someone wants to do something, they will do it no matter what. I used to think positively about this mentality in a positive way. Still, now I understand that I need to look at this in a negative way, which is the only way people will think about that statement. Beware of the hypocrites.. they are closer than you think and might already be controlling your life. It's never too late to cut them...
