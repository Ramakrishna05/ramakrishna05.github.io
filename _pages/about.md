Hello there! I am Ramakrishna. Thank you for stopping by! I am doing a PhD in Neural Machine Translation at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna). I have completed my master's in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Hyderabad (UoH) and my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Gurajada-Vizianagaram (JNTU-GV).

I am very much interested in Neuroscience and how the human brain works. I want to explore and study how the human brain creates memories after my Ph.D.

I am from Punuru village, which is approximately 60 km away from Guntur city in the state of Andhra Pradesh, and my mother tongue is Telugu. I used to watch Anime and read Manga. Naruto, Guts, Lelouch, and Kaneki Ken are my favourite people. I am a massive fan of Mr Irrfan Khan, Mr Hayao Miyazaki, Mr Christopher Nolan, Mr Steven Spielberg, Mr Martin Scorsese, Mr Robert De Niro, Mr Tom Hanks, Mr Al Pacino, Mr Johnny Depp, Mr Keanu Reeves, Mr Christian Bale, Ms Natalie Portman, and Mr Tom Hardy. I love music.. mostly chill house, EDM, tropical house. I love tea. I want to sit and enjoy a good cup of tea on a rainy evening..! I want to write stories about some of the exciting events in my life and upload them to this website. Thanks again for stopping by! Have a nice day... <3
